==================
L.I.S.A Git Policy
==================

The L.I.S.A team follows a git policy to maintain stability and consistency
with the repository.

The git policy has been developed to encourage contributions and make contributing
to L.I.S.A as easy as possible. Code contributors to L.I.S.A projects DO NOT NEED
TO READ THIS DOCUMENT, because all contributions come into L.I.S.A via a single
gateway to make it as easy as possible for contributors to give us code.

The primary rule of git management in L.I.S.A is to make life easy on
contributors and developers to send in code. Simplicity is always a goal!
