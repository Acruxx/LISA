Distribute your Plugin
======================

Python package
==============
One you have created your plugin, you may want to distribute it.

LISA use python package index to manage plugin dependencies and install/uninstall. With this system, plugins can be used
as a library in another plugin as it's a python package.

The `create </topics/plugins/create>` option does not create the structure to deploy it.

To create the structure, you can check how plugins are actually done : `ChatterBot Plugin`_
