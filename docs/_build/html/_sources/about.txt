About

This project is one of the lot of J.A.R.V.I.S project we can found on the net. (J.A.R.V.I.S is the IA developed by Tony Stark in Iron Man)

I decided to create my own version because I didn't found any good project to contribute. Or the concept wasn't good enough to fit my needs. I want something fast, easy to understand, easy to edit, easy to add features. Something small enough to run on a cheap computer like Raspberry Pi.

J.A.R.V.I.S will assist me like a Digital Like Assistant. It will give me usefull informations even if I didn't ask these, and answer me when I will ask something I want to know or to do. I actually have my house managed by a Vera-Lite controller (Zwave). J.A.R.V.I.S will be able to manage it (and other box with a simple module) and allow me to control with my house by voice.
