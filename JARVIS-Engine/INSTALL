The easiest way is to run the installer. As it's open source, you can see it will only install python packages necessary to run J.A.R.V.I.S.
You need to be in the top directory (JARVIS) where there is the README.md file.
::

  sh install/install.sh

(Actually I use the django toolbar to debug ... so add it with:)

::

  sudo pip -r install/optional.txt

Then, go into JARVIS-ENGINE and run :
::

  twistd -ny jarvis.py

To install plugins : http://localhost:8000/plugins/ (the interface have not Ajax yet, so after clicking on an action, reload the page with F5 !)
Plugins aren't translated yet. By default it will use the english language. Change the JARVIS-Engine/Configuration/jarvis.json lang attribute to "en" to use english in plugins, then look how a plugin is built, you will see it's very easy to add a new language to the plugin.


You should be able to go to http://localhost:8000/speech/ (a webinterface will come soon and the twisted program will be daemonized as a service in the future).
